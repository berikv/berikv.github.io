## The Good the Bad and the Ugly

> "Oh no! The status meeting is today; Another two hours of my life utterly wasted."
 
> "I wish this person to stop talking just for a minute so I can hear anything else but them!"
 
> "Better bring coffee and cookies to this meeting, it is going to last for a while.."

If these thoughts sound familiar to you, you came to the right place.

Did you know that meetings score the lowest out of all office activities? And they are also bloody expensive!
Lets calculate how much  meetings actually cost. Open your calendar and add all the time spend in meetings last week. Then multiply by the average amount of people in those meetings, then multiply by the average hourly rate.

I insist you do that now. Calculate the total meeting cost for your team.

The calculated cost is what your company invests into meetings. And what for? To make you feel unhappy? To waste your time? Is it because your company hates its office workers? I don't believe so.

Besides the company cost, there is also the mental energy cost of meetings. As a meeting participant you can be either drained of energy. This cost is harder to calculate, and varies strongly from person to person and meeting to meeting. It is also possible to have meetings that boost mental energy. Can you think back to those meetings? What were their properties?

So why do we have meetings? Meetings are important.

- Meetings give you, the employee, a sense of belonging
- Meetings build a social structure for supporting the companies goals
- Meetings are used to check if everyone makes progress on their work
- During Meetings you can reflect, together, on your work
- Meetings provide some time away from the keyboard
- Meetings can initiate a change in culture or process
- Meetings are used to make a good impression on your coworkers

Clearly meetings have many uses. To improve meetings, some of these uses will have to find a different place or format.

Lets unpack the overloaded word "Meeting". In this article, "meeting" means a group of people getting together sharing work status and solutions, interact and discuss, and make decisions together.

In this article, the word "meeting" is NOT used for

- Presentations
- Social gathering
- Team lunch
- Outage mitigation

## A Good Meeting

These are attributes of a pleasant meeting.

1. One Topic
2. Topic actually needs collaboration now
3. Only include people absolutely needed
4. Well Prepared by all participants
5. Equal speaking time for each participant
6. Disagreements are addressed
7. Book 15 minutes for a meeting, 30 minutes absolute maximum
8. Avoid booking meetings during focus times

### One Topic

Limit the amount of things you want to discuss in the meeting to ONE. This allows you to invite fewer people. The meeting can also be shorter.

### Topic actually needs collaboration now

Do not bring people together and ask them to spend time discussing a topic that has no actual problem. This may sound obvious, but think back. I'm sure you can think of discussions that ended with no solution because there was no actual problem in the first place. Avoiding these topics altogether is a big time saver and mental energy booster.

### Only include people absolutely needed

Get the number of invites down.

How?

Some of your team members may be impacted by a decision made in the meeting. They surely need to be in the meeting, right?

Not necessarily. They could trust other team members to make the right decision. Invite the people that are trusted (by the others who are impacted) to make the right considerations.

It is helpful to make this trust relation explicit, eg: "As a team, we trust you to keep us informed on the status of ..." and "If there is a risk of ... we want to hear that from you."

After the meeting is done, a summary needs to be shared with anyone who may be impacted by the discussed topic. This increases the trust and gives everyone a chance to ask for clarification if they feel its needed.

A practical example: You may want to invite a remote team to discuss an integration project. Stop there. Reach out to the manager of the remote team instead. Ask them to select one of their team members who will be your contact person. Your contact person decides if they need members of their team in a meeting, based on what expertise is needed.

Giving responsibility and trust boosts the team spirit as well as the mental energy.

With fewer persons in a meeting the risk of misunderstandings and unneeded discussions is also reduced.

### Preparation

The biggest time and mental energy is wasted during meetings by **Misunderstandings**.

I've been in meetings where the central topic had to be explained up to three times because attendees did not know the details of what is being discussed (and they got confused or where not paying attention the first and second time). Other attendees get bored or frustrated by all this repetition. They may interrupt the explanation to try and speed it up, causing even more confusion. Avoid this situation at all cost by preparing well.

Prepare as the organizer.

- Describe the topic in a document and share it well before the meeting
- Use images and diagrams to clarify the topic further
- Answer questions about the topic with enough detail, update the document with the answers
- Ask the meeting participants to read up and prepare

Prepare as a participant.

- Your expertise is asked for
- Be the expert
- Study beforehand
- Have answers on your specialty ready
- Prepare questions that can be answered by the other invitees

There is a big difference between a well prepared question and a not-so-well prepared one.

Consider these two questions:

- "Can't we speed up our authentication service?"
- "What would it cost to improve the 95th percentile response time from 300ms to 100ms on the authentication service?"

 The latter question clearly needed preparation: You needed to figure out what kind of reasonable improvement still yields a much better user experience. It also is a question that clearly has an answer.
 The former question, on the other hand, will likely be met with a shoulder shrug, or worse, with a defensive attitude.

### Equal speaking time for each participant



### Disagreements are addressed

Maximum one level of 'back and forth' for a disagreement

## How to Change Meetings

Because we are lazy and it is easier to capture the existing meeting for some information that only half of the group needs.
Having energetic short meetings requires preparation and organisation.

To make things worse, improving meetings requires preparation, organisation and more time investment from **Managers, PMs and other leadership functions**.
The time of these leaders is the most valued, so better keep the interaction with the team simple right? Just one two-and-a-half-hour pain session and you are done with your leadership obligations for this week towards this team.
Leaders set the example. To become a leader, you better have your own two-and-a-half hour meetings planned next year.
