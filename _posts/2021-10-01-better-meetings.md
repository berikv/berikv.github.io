## The Good the Bad and the Ugly

> "Oh no! The status meeting is today; Another two hours of my life utterly wasted."

> "I wish this person to stop talking just for a minute so I can hear anything else but them!"

> "Better bring coffee and cookies to this meeting, it is going to last for a while.."

If these thoughts sound familiar to you, you came to the right place.

Did you know that meetings receive the lowest productivity rating? *Add reference to actual data*

Not only that, meetings are also expensive for the company you work for.
Lets calculate how much a meeting actually cost your company. Open your calendar and add all the time spend in meetings last week. Then multiply by the average amount of people in those meetings, then multiply by the average hourly rate. I insist you do that now. Calculate the total meeting cost for your team.

The calculated cost is what your company invests into meetings. And what for? To make you feel unhappy? To waste your time? Is it because your company hates its office workers? I don't believe so.

Besides the company cost, there is also the mental energy cost of meetings. As a meeting participant you can be drained of energy. This cost is harder to calculate, and varies strongly from person to person and meeting to meeting. It is also possible to have meetings that boost mental energy. Can you think back to those meetings? What were their properties?

So why do we have meetings? Meetings are important.

- Meetings give you, the employee, a sense of belonging
- Meetings build a social structure for supporting the companies goals
- Meetings are used to check if everyone makes progress on their work
- During Meetings you can reflect, together, on your work
- Meetings provide some time away from the keyboard
- Meetings can initiate a change in culture or process
- Meetings are used to make a good impression on your coworkers

Clearly meetings have many uses. And they are not liked much. Can we untangle this? Is it possible to improve meetings in general? What would a nice meeting be like?

Lets first unpack the overloaded word "Meeting". In this article, a "meeting" means that a group of people spend time together to share their work status, review / discuss / plan their work, and make decisions.

In this article, the word "meeting" is **not** used for

- Presentations
- Social gatherings
- Team lunch
- Outage mitigation

## A Good Meeting

...

### 1. One Topic

Limit the amount of things you want to discuss in the meeting to just **one**.
Doing so will unlock all other ways to improve the meeting. For example, it is easier to invite fewer people and to prepare well and have a shorter meeting if there is only one topic to be discussed.

### 2. Topic actually needs collaboration now

Before sending out the invite, ask yourself if the issue you want to address during the meeting really needs other peoples attention, and if a meeting is the right way to address it.

For example; Consider replacing a weekly status update meeting with an e-mail or website that features the latest status updates. You could even record demo's and feature those. Then if a stakeholder has feedback, you can plan a meeting specifically for receiving that feedback.

Another example; Imagine you have a great idea on your way to work. You want to tell your coworkers, get their buy-in and start working on it. If you would continue to follow these desires, your coworkers may not receive it so well: Will this idea work? How will their work be impacted? Should they stop working now and change everything?

A better approach is to old off your temptation to share your idea. Instead draw it and / or write your idea down. Explain it in words that your team can understand. Write down what will change, what the downsides are of following your idea. Now if you still feel that your idea is great, you can start sharing it. Now is the time to share your notes and draw it on a whiteboard. You have the answers ready for the most obvious questions.

### 3. Only include people absolutely needed

Get the number of invites down.

How?

Some of your team members may be impacted by a decision made in the meeting. They surely need to be in the meeting, right?

Not necessarily. They could trust other team members to make the right decision. Invite the people that are trusted (by the others who are impacted) to make the right considerations.

It is helpful to make this trust relation explicit, eg: "As a team, we trust you to keep us informed on the status of ..." and "If there is a risk of ... we want to hear that from you."

After the meeting is done, a summary needs to be shared with anyone who may be impacted by the discussed topic. This increases the trust and gives everyone a chance to ask for clarification if they feel its needed.

A practical example: You may want to invite a remote team to discuss an integration project. Stop there. Reach out to the manager of the remote team instead. Ask them to select one of their team members who will be your contact person. Your contact person decides if they need members of their team in a meeting, based on what expertise is needed.

Giving responsibility and trust boosts the team spirit as well as the mental energy.

With fewer persons in a meeting the risk of misunderstandings and unneeded discussions is also reduced.

### 4. Well Prepared

The biggest time and mental energy is wasted during meetings by **misunderstandings**.

I've been in meetings where the central topic had to be explained up to three times because attendees did not know the details of what is being discussed (and they got confused or where not paying attention the first and second time). Other attendees get bored or frustrated by all this repetition. They may interrupt the explanation to try and speed it up, causing even more confusion. Avoid this situation at all cost by preparing well.

Prepare as the organizer.

- Describe the topic in a document and share it well before the meeting
- Use images and diagrams to clarify the topic further
- Ask the meeting participants to read up and prepare
- Answer questions about the topic with enough detail, update the document with the answers

Prepare as a participant.

- Your expertise is asked for
- Be the expert
- Study the topic
- Have answers on your expertise ready
- Prepare questions that can be answered by the other invitees

There is a big difference between a well prepared question and a not-so-well prepared one.

Consider these two questions:

- "Can't we speed up our authentication service?"
- "What would it cost to improve the 95th percentile response time from 300ms to 100ms on the authentication service?"

 The latter question needed preparation: You needed to figure out what kind of reasonable improvement still yields a much better user experience. It also is a question that unambiguously asks for an answer.
 The former question, on the other hand, will likely be met with a shoulder shrug, or worse, with a defensive attitude.

### Equal speaking time

By sticking to the above principles money and mental energy wasting has been greatly reduced. Now it is time to build up the moral energy into the positive. How can a meeting give mental energy to its participants?

This is one reason why standup meetings are so successful: Everyone gets to say at least something.

If you talk for 80% of the time, don't have a meeting. Instead prepare a **presentation**.

We often feel the need to help others by finishing their sentences and filling in their ideas. Especially the leads and managers tend to have this tendency. Cutting others off while they are trying to share their ideas is not going to help them or you. Unfortunately it is not easily recognized when you do it yourself (I speak form experience). **Help by interrupting the interruption**. Make sure that each participant can make their point uninterrupted until it is understood. Give time to those participants who speak slowly. The goal is to have roughly equal amount of input from each participant.

There is no hierarchy between the meeting participants. Remember that each participant has prepared well and is in the meeting to share their expertise.

Some leaders have the tendency to act like a TV show host. After introducing the topic, they ask a question to one of the participants, repeat their answer and explain it in more detail, then repeat until it is time to wrap up. This communication style has two benefits: The other participants can safely wait until a specific question is asked to them and give the shortest answer possible. The leader has full control over the progress of the meeting and can mute any discussion simply because they own the whole meeting and all what is said within.

### Disagreements are addressed

Disagreements are bound to happen, especially during meetings. Follow these steps to make the most out of a disagreement.

1. Speak up, make it clear that you disagree
2. Validate, together, that the disagreement is not because of a misunderstanding
3. Document the arguments
4. Document the difference in values
5. Continue with the rest of the meeting

After the meeting, validate your understanding of the different viewpoints. Share a summary of the disagreements.

Keep in mind that each person has their own view and acts out of their own best interest.

Look for common ground. Suggest experimenting one way or the other to find whats best.

Commit to resolving the disagreement and let the others know that you commit to the solution.

### Care for your invitees

Care for your invitees, both professionally and personally.

- Book the meeting during a convenient time (think of timezones, avoid focus hours)
- Make sure that your invitees can join, consider asking them to be on time
- Tell each invitee why you value their contribution
- Check if all participants feel fine (not ill, tired, rushed)
- Stop the meeting well before invitees have to leave

### No longer than half an hour

When you step into the room where a 60 minutes meeting will take place, you can sense it. People are being distracted, talking about their weekends, while the person who'll do most of the talking is very busy looking in their notes and making some last minute adjustments to their slides. These types of meetings are the pain of office life. Often this type of meeting will feature a presentation part and then some interaction between a few of the attendees. There will also be a part of the team that wished they could continue their normal work, and maybe even a part that just continues their normal work **during** the meeting. Often these meetings are also recurring.

Now there may be very good reasons for a 60 minute meeting. For example when the invitees have to travel far or are otherwise not available for several shorter meetings. If those reasons exist, then inform your invitees about them. Your invitees are more likely to understand why you ask them to sit through it.

Our attention span is only so long. And way shorter than most meetings we are in.

A 15 minute meetings are rated the most effective. Aim for that sweet spot.
15 minutes may sound short but 15 minutes can be more than enough when everyone came well prepared.
