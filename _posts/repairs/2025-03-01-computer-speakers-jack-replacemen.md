The 3mm Jack Plug of these computer speakers is mangled up pretty bad.

We find a decent replacement cable in the cubbord, decide on the length, and I get to soldering:

Soldering such tiny cables is fiddely.

I turn up the heat to 400C, so that the soldering iron can burn off the enamel from the enameled core.
Use plenty of tin and make sure all the cores are properly tinned before you start attaching them.

Some cheap audio cables have aluminium cores that are impossible to solder.

Avoid those.

If you must connect aluminium cores, then do not try to solder them. Try to use crimps instead. Good luck!

The audio cable on these speakers is fine though, as is the spare cable with the jack plug.

Before soldering, I measured continuity between the cores and the jack plug. For sterea audio jacks, from tip to the back, the order is right, left, ground.
Make double sure you have **ground** of the jack side connected to **ground** on the speaker side.

On the cable with the replacement jack plug, the right channel has reddish enamel and the left channel has greenish enamel, Cute!

I made sure to add some shrink tube over the soldering job on the left and right cores.
Another shrink tube covering both cables entirely would have been nice.

In this case I used electrical tape, which also protects the soldering joint a little from anyone jerking the cable.
Nothing is perfect, and this fix is mediocre. The customer is happy, and that is most important.
