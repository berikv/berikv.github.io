The first repair was a Sony DVD player. I didn't note down the exact version of this machine. From what I've seen, they are all build similarly.

On the inside, these machines have a box-standard DVD mechanism with a custom tray with flip door. There is a mains power supply which takes almost half the space inside the device.
Sony clearly tied to make margin by buying a cheap PSU. This one works, so we'll ignore that.

The fault of this device is that the tray wouldn't open. When pressing the eject button, you could hear some motor spinning, and the door did move.
If you'd hold the flip door open, the tray would come out.

This is a common issue with Tape, CD and DVD players. The elastic bands that are used as drive belts age and loose their tension.
In this machine, the elastic band seemed to be alright. However, once a new elastic band is installed, the tray would function properly.

To find the belt, **gently** open the tray. Wiggle the mechanicals if the tray does not come out easily. Take your time here.

Once the tray is halfway out, you'll see the elastic band. Remove it with a small screwdriver or pin.

To install the new band, first wrangle it underneeth the tray and behind the drive wheel. Once in place, tension the band and hook it behind the driven wheel.

You can learn more about the elastic band replacement on [this iFixit page](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Samsung+DVD-HD850+Player+Rubber+Band+Replacement/32853), the brand is different, but the procedure is mostly the same.

You can purchase these belts [in a set](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/set-van-7-vierkante-rubberen-aandrijf-riemen-snaren-voor-cd-en-dvd-spelers-cassette-recorders/9300000157340946/) or [exactly sized for the use case](https://webspareparts.com/en-nl/collections/cd-players-belts?srsltid=AfmBOoqUJXE8OTANbCj4GaJQamllozXLfzvQV8Oqamh_eStLjYSR-lFs).

The repair caf√© has cheaper set of elastic bands. For this tray I used one of the smallest bands, probably 4cm circumference.

Tested opening and closing the tray 5 times in a row, worked like a charm.

An almost exact copy of this machine, with the exact same issue is being repaired at the same time by one of the other repairman.
They find that the small size belt is too small, and blocks the motor. I don't know the details, but they found another belt that did work.

Time for the next repair!
