# The Good the Bad and the Ugly

 "Oh no! The status meeting at 13h; Two hours of my life utterly wasted today."
 
 "I wish this person to stop talking just for a minute so I can hear anything else but them!"
 
 "Better bring coffee and cookies, this one is going to last for a while.."

These thoughts may be familiar to you. If so, you came to the right place.

Did you know that meetings score the lowest out of all office activities? And the crazy thing is, they are also bloody expensive!
To get a figure, open your last-week calendar and add all the time spend in meetings. Then multiply by the average amount of people in those meetings. Then multiply by the average salary.

I mean, do it now, for real. Calculate the total meeting cost for your team.

That is the amount your company invests into meetings. And what for? To make you feel unhappy? Is it because your company hates its office workers? I don't believe so.

Meetings are important.
- Meetings give you, the employee, a sense of belonging
- Meetings build a social structure for supporting the companies goals
- Meetings are used to check if everyone makes progress on their work
- During Meetings you can reflect, together, on your work
- Meetings provide some time away from the keyboard
- Meetings can initiate a change in culture or process
- Meetings are used to make a good impression on your coworkers

To improve meetings, some of these uses will have to find a different format.
But how did we get to the current bad state of meetings? Because there are too many reasons for the meeting to be there.
Because we are lazy and it is easier to capture the existing meeting for some information that only half of the group needs.
Having energetic short meetings requires preparation and organisation.

To make things worse, improving meetings requires preparation, organisation and more time investment from **Managers, PMs and other leadership functions**.
The time of these leaders is the most valued, so better keep the interaction with the team simple right? Just one two-and-a-half-hour pain session and you are done with your leadership obligations for this week towards this team.
Leaders set the example. To become a leader, you better have your own two-and-a-half hour meetings planned next year.

As a frist step in improving meetings, lets define what they are not.

Meetings are not
- Presentations
- Social gathering / team lunch
- Outage mitigation
